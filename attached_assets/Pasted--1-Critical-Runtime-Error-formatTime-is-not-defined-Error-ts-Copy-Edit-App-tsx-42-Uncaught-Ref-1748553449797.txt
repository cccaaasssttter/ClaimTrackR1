üî¥ 1. Critical Runtime Error: formatTime is not defined
Error:

ts
Copy
Edit
App.tsx:42 Uncaught ReferenceError: formatTime is not defined
Fix:
You are using a formatTime() function without importing or defining it in App.tsx. Find that line and either:

Define the formatTime() function

Or import it from wherever it lives

üî¥ 2. Broken Authentication Manager Call
Error:

ts
Copy
Edit
authManager.getTimeRemaining is not a function
Fix:
Check authManager.ts or wherever authManager is defined. You‚Äôre calling a method that doesn‚Äôt exist. Either:

Implement getTimeRemaining

Or stop calling it if it's no longer relevant

‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Invalid WebSocket URL
Error:

ts
Copy
Edit
WebSocket: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid.
Cause:
You're likely constructing the WebSocket URL dynamically but missing a port or host.

Fix:
Ensure you default to the correct hostname and port in development:

ts
Copy
Edit
const wsURL = process.env.WS_URL || `wss://${location.hostname}:${location.port}/?token=...`;
‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Prop Warnings from React
txt
Copy
Edit
Warning: React does not recognize the `hideCloseButton` prop
Fix:
Props like hideCloseButton aren‚Äôt native HTML attributes. Remove them from DOM elements (like <div>) or pass them only to custom components that accept them.

‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Missing ARIA for Accessibility
txt
Copy
Edit
DialogContent requires a DialogTitle...
Fix:
You‚Äôre using @radix-ui/react-dialog and didn‚Äôt include a <DialogTitle />. Add it, even if it‚Äôs hidden:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { VisuallyHidden } from '@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden';
<DialogTitle><VisuallyHidden>Title</VisuallyHidden></DialogTitle>
‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Network and Font Warnings
txt
Copy
Edit
[Intervention] Slow network is detected.
Failed to load: segment analytics
These are non-breaking but slow down your app in dev mode. You can disable Segment or use local fonts to improve loading.

‚úÖ What to Do Next:
Fix the formatTime reference in App.tsx.

Verify and correct authManager.getTimeRemaining.

Patch WebSocket setup with a proper fallback/default.

Audit any custom props leaking into raw HTML elements.

Add missing accessibility structure to dialogs.
